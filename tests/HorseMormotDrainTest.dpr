  Horse + mORMot  —  graceful-shutdown drain probe
  =====================================================
  Destination: horse-provider-crosssocket/tests/HorseCSDrainTest.dpr

  Requires HORSE_PROVIDER_CROSSSOCKET in Project Options -> Conditional defines.
  Plain HTTP on port 9232 — no TLS, no certs, nothing to install.
  (mORMot's probe uses 9202, ICS's 9212, the CrossSocket TLS suite 9101.
  NOT 9222: that is the Chrome/Edge DevTools remote-debugging default. See below.)

  ONE QUESTION: when you call StopListenGraceful(N) with a request in flight,
  does that request finish and does its reply reach the client?

  That is the question a graceful shutdown exists to answer, and it is NOT the
  same as "is the call bounded by N". The elapsed time cannot be bounded below
  the remaining work without abandoning the thread running it — IOCP's StopLoop
  asks its IO threads to exit and bounds its own completion drain at 3000 ms, but
  an IO thread inside a 5000 ms handler cannot observe that until the handler
  returns. An earlier version of this probe asserted that bound and scored every
  provider as failing it, which conflated a real defect (the reply is discarded)
  with correct behaviour (teardown waits for handler threads).

  Why it needs asking. THorseProviderAbstract.StopListenGraceful sets the
  shutting-down flag, calls StopListen and never references ATimeoutMS:

      class procedure THorseProviderAbstract.StopListenGraceful(
        const ATimeoutMS: Integer);
      begin
        THorseCore.SetIsShuttingDown(True);
        try
          StopListen;
        finally
          THorseCore.SetIsShuttingDown(False);
        end;
      end;

  Seven internal providers override it — Console, Daemon, FPC.Daemon, FPC.LCL,
  HttpSys, IOCP, VCL. The Console one is the reference: it polls
  GetActiveRequests until zero, bounded by ATimeoutMS. NONE of the three
  external providers (CrossSocket, mORMot, ICS) overrides it, so all three
  inherit the version above — and horse/.agents/AGENTS.md makes the override
  mandatory for any provider that owns the TCP socket.

  Each of those providers does drain, but on its OWN clock: Stop waits
  FConfig.DrainTimeoutMs. So the caller's number is silently replaced by a
  config value, and a caller asking for 30 s may get 5 s, or vice versa.

  Measured 2026-09-24, both 5/5 with a control, both FAILING this assertion:
    mORMot  4200 ms, in-flight response lost at 5012 ms (when the handler ended)
    ICS     4204 ms, in-flight response lost at  816 ms (the instant shutdown began)
  Neither was bounded by its argument OR by its own DrainTimeoutMs, because a
  later teardown step blocks on the very work the timeout was meant to bound.

  ── WHY THIS SHAPE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Server on the MAIN thread, shutdown from a driver thread. mORMot's
  InternalListen blocks the main thread on FStopEvent when IsConsole is True,
  exactly like the CrossSocket provider, and Stop is what signals that event — so
  this is the shape a real console app has, and the shape the CrossSocket probe
  was rewritten into after its own worker-thread version proved unreadable.

  ── WHAT mORMot's Stop DOES TODAY ──────────────────────────────────────────
      FRunning := False;
      FreeAndNil(FServer);        // terminates mORMot's thread pool - BLOCKS
      FreeAndNil(FHandler);
      if FActiveRequests > 0 then
        FDrainEvent.WaitFor(FConfig.DrainTimeoutMs);   // after the free

  The drain wait is AFTER the free, and the provider's own comment concedes it:
  "After FServer.Free, mORMot threads have stopped; FActiveRequests should
  already be 0, but we honour the drain timeout for safety." So nothing waits for
  an in-flight request before its server is destroyed.

  Measured 2026-09-24, 5/5 with a control: 4200 ms elapsed (= 5000 - 800, the rest
  of the request, bounded by NEITHER timeout) and the reply lost. Note the timing
  differed from ICS and CrossSocket, which lost the reply at ~810 ms, the instant
  shutdown began: mORMot lost it at ~5012 ms, when the handler FINISHED. That is a
  different mechanism — the handler ran to completion and then had no server left
  to answer through — and it is why this is being re-measured with the fuller
  instrumentation below rather than assumed to match CrossSocket.

  mORMot does have the knob CrossSocket lacked: THttpServerGeneric.Shutdown sets
  fShutdownInProgress, and Request() then answers HTTP_NOTFOUND to NEW requests
  while in-flight ones continue, without touching any socket. Whether calling it
  before the drain is enough is a question for the measurement, not for this
  comment.

  ── TWO MODES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  deliver (default)   GET /quick (1500 ms), shutdown fired 800 ms in,
                      StopListenGraceful(4000). The timeout is LONGER than the
                      700 ms of work left, which is the shape Horse's own DUnitX
                      fixture uses for Indy. Two assertions:
                        G1  the reply arrives - 200 + body 'done'
                        G2  the call returns inside its 4000 ms timeout
                      G1 is the regression test for FIX-CS-GRACEFUL-1 and FAILS
                      against the unpatched provider, where CloseAll severs the
                      connection at the shutdown point and the client gets 12152.

  bound               GET /slow (5000 ms), shutdown fired 800 ms in,
                      StopListenGraceful(500) - timeout SHORTER than the work
                      left. REPORT-ONLY: the reply is legitimately abandoned
                      because the timeout expired while work was still running,
                      and the total is expected to exceed the timeout because
                      teardown waits for the handler thread. Run it as
                      `HorseCSDrainTest.exe bound`. The three distances it prints
                      say which of 500 / 3000 / 4200 the elapsed time matches.

  Elapsed time alone never distinguished a delivered reply from a severed one -
  that is why G1 asserts the BODY. A status code cannot carry that, and neither
  can a duration.

  ── DIAGNOSTICS: what a 404 means, from counters ───────────────────────────
  An onRequest hook counts entries into Horse's router and records what it was
  given. The hook fires BEFORE path matching (Horse.Core.RouterTree.pas:418
  wraps GetPathSegments and ExecuteInternal inside it), so its count separates
  "never reached Horse" from "reached Horse, matched nothing":

    pipeline=0                     the request never reached Horse's router.
                                   mORMot or the request bridge answered by
                                   itself. Read the status: 400 = Host/SEC-17,
                                   413 = size limit, 404 with pipeline=0 means
                                   CrossSocket answered a route Horse never saw.
    pipeline>0, /ping handler=0,
    hook saw PathInfo '/ping'      the router was handed the right path and did
                                   not match it. A routing defect, and the body
                                   will be Horse's own 'Not Found'.
    pipeline>0, /ping handler=0,
    hook saw something else        PathInfo/segmentation defect — GetPathSegments
                                   delegates to RawPathInfo, which keeps the
                                   FCSPathInfo branch on this provider.
    /ping handler>0 but 404        the handler ran and the reply was lost coming
                                   back: a response-bridge defect, not routing.

  A deliberately unregistered path is requested too, so "everything 404s" and
  "only /ping 404s" are distinguishable rather than guessed at.
